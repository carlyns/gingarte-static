GUIDELINES FOR GOOD COPY

<li>THEM, NOT US</li>
<li>People are less interested in what we’re doing, and more interested in how it can help them. </li>
<li>Copy should focus on what we’re offering, who might need it, and most importantly, how/ why it’s useful. </li>

<li>(shared pipeline of incoming shows/demonstrations and thresholds for publishing as a public event to invite fans, )</li>



<div class="notes"><h4>what we need to improve in general for ALL CLASSES
</h4>
<p>professional locations, check-in process, payment options, sessions that make sense, </p>


<h4>how to get more students to UofC: </h4>new posts via social media (see "connect" section), offer demos to related groups (Brazilian Students Assn, portugese language department, do a quarterly potluck and invite students and meetup groups, beginners session every quarter, creating a sense of community and relief from studies, make it a serious cultural endeavor learning about brazilian socio-poli-economic issues and how lower classes were able to be happy/generous/celebrate in light of so much struggle, couple each class with online video of contemporary (not just historical/tied to slavery) roda/students/street life/favela, partner with UofC teacher for curriculum?, make it sophisticated, directly correlate to life studies/balance/psychology, tie directly to community work in Chicago and lower-class here perhaps recruit from UTEP and teach life lessons that kids can learn from capoeira, )
