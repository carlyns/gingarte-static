	<div class="description"><p>We always try to stay connected with current events happening in Brazil.  Capoeira stems from the struggles of the lower-class, so these social issues are close to our hearts.  </p>	</div>
	<hr>

	<h3>capoeira origins</h3>
	<p>Capoeira started as during the slave trade in Brazil, as a way for slaves to practice self-defense without getting caught.  They disguised it as a dance by incorporating music, instruments, and dance-live movements that could turn deadly.  It was outlawed in Brazil until Mestre Bimba legitimized it.  </p>

	<div class="dances" id="dances">
		<h3>related dances and music</h3>
		<p>Other traditional cultural dances are go ahnd-in-hand with the training capoeira since its origins.  </p>
		<div class="dance"><h4>Maculelê</h4>
			<img src="imgs/dances/maculele1.jpg" alt="maculele image">
			<p>Either originating from slaves in sugar-cane plantations or from a real-life African hero named "Maculele" (conflicting stories), the tradition is represented today with a spectacular, high-energy mock-fight dance performed with sticks and machetes to the rapid beat of drums.
			</p></div>
		<div class="dance"><h4>Dança Guerreira</h4>
			<img src="imgs/dances/dancaguerreira1.jpg" alt="guerreira image">
			<p>Dança Guerreira is a powerful dance representing a tribe preparing for fight. The choreography includes dancers in traditional clothing and body paint who are armed with swords and shields.
			</p></div>
		<div class="dance"><h4>Samba</h4>
			<img src="imgs/dances/samba2.jpg" alt="samba image">
			<p>Samba, characterized by vibrating hips and fast moving feet, is the official Brazilian dance of Carnaval. Radiant dancers wear Carnaval costumes and dance to live samba percussion.
			</p></div>
		<div class="dance"><h4>Puxada de Rede</h4>
			<img src="imgs/dances/puxadaderede1.jpg" alt="puxada image">
			<p>Puxada de Rede (or ‘pulling of the net’) is a folkloric theatrical dance about the simple life of Brazilian fishermen and the celebration of a successful catch. The graceful dance involves live music with passionate lyrics reflecting the natural beauty and daily struggles of the life of a fisherman.

		<div class="description">
			<p>Marisa Cordeiro brought capoeira from Brazil to Chicago, founding Gingarte Capoeira in 1991.  Since then, our group has grown into a thriving community of over 100 students and performers, many of whom have been with the school for over a decade.
			</p>
		</div>
		<hr>
			<h3>group history</h3>
				<p>Our group started as a few capoeiristas in a park in Washington Park on Chicago's south side.
				</p>
				<p>We have been housed at Jane Addams, in Hyde Park and in West Town.  Many of our longest students have been promoted to teachers and continue to volunteer their time to teach for the organization presently.
				</p>
				<p>You may have seen us performing around town in Millennium Park, Old Town School of Folk Music, Texas de Brasil, Carnivale, and other corporate events.
				</p>
			<h3>mestre marisa</h3>
				<div class="marisa"><img src="imgs/teachers/marisa1.jpg" alt="mestre marisa thumbnail"></div>
				<p>Our group trains and practices under the tutelage of Mestre Marisa Cordeiro, who ranks among the highest female capoeiristas in the United States. She is well respected both in the U.S. and Brazil as a pioneer for women in capoeira.				</p>

				<p>Mestre Marisa Cordeiro is the founder and executive director of Gingarte Capoeira and a shining symbol of the Brazilian community in Chicago. Born in Curvelo, Brazil, Marisa trained at the prestigious Cordão de Ouro Capoeira Academy in São Paulo with top instructors such as Mestre Suassuna, Mestre Canguru, and Mestre Urubu Malandro. She is one of the highest-ranking female capoeiristas in the world.
				</p>
				<p>Mestre Marisa first came to the United States in 1989 as a performer with the renowned international group Oba Oba. They performed throughout the United States and Latin America. Two years later, she returned to Chicago and established Gingarte Capoeira in 1991.

		Capoeira has the incredible power to provide focus, creativity and opportunity.  We strive to bring our programs to underserved communities in Chicago.
